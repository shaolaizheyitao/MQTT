A brief introduction to some of the concepts found in MQTT can be found in the [MQTT manpage](http://mosquitto.org/man/mqtt-7.html) on the mosquitto website.

Another brief introduction can be found in the [Eclipse Newsletter](https://eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2014/february/article2.php) on the Eclipse website.

There is a very nice overview of MQTT available here: [What is MQTT and how does it work with WebSphere MQ?](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/aimsupport/entry/what_is_mqtt_and_how_does_it_work_with_websphere_mq?lang=en)
