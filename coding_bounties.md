# Ideas for apps

Have an idea for an MQTT app but don't have the time, skill or knowledge to create it? or just a cool idea you want to share with the community? add it to the list below.


*  [web-based MQTT graphing](http://mosquitto.org/2012/01/challenge-web-based-mqtt-graphing/) - a challenge by [Roger Light](http://twitter.com/ralight) on the Mosquitto blog

*  a "modern" replacement for [IA92](IA92)
    * cross-platform... could be Java.
    * Needs updating to latest MQTT v3.1 with user auth - use Eclipse Paho Java client!
    * could look a lot nicer (running IA92 with platform-native LaF improves it for a start)

*  a PyGTK desktop pub/sub testing app similar to the GUI in [IA92](IA92)

*  example mobile apps with source
    * BlackBerry (JavaME?) 
    * Windows Phone mobile app with source

*  port of MQTT to [TI Launchpad](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/MSP430_LaunchPad_%28MSP-EXP430G2%29)
    * (is this even possible given platform limitations?)
    * This seems like a prime candidate for MQTT-S [RF BoosterPack](http://www.ti.com/tool/430boost-cc110l)

*  MQTT client for [NeTV](http://wiki.chumby.com/index.php/What_is_NeTV)

*  LED panel client and server

*  add your idea here :-)
## Completed

*  an app for eInk/non-Fire Kindles
    * the Kindle is Linux+Java - "should" be simple to use to display an MQTT data feed... assuming you can code for the Kindle without the unreleased KDK
    * jailbreak needed
    * in progress from [@aefaradien](http://twitter.com/aefaradien) code [MqttDesu](https///gitorious.org/mqttdesu)
    * [blog post about how this was done](http://vaguehope.com/2012/01/mqtt-kindlet/)
    * [presentation from the London Green Hackathon](http://lanyrd.com/spghg)
